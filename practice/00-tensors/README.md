# 00. Tensors

## Basics

Tensors are one of the core building blocks of Pytorch, and here are a few types of them:

**Scalar**: Basically a single number, and in "tensor-speak," it's a *zero dimension* tensor.
- Dimensions: `0`
- Example usage: `a`

`In [1]:`
```python
import torch

scalar = torch.tensor(69)
scalar, scalar.ndim
```

`Out[1]:`
```python
(tensor(69), 0)
```

<br />

**Vector**: A single-dimensional tensor that can contain many numbers.
- Dimensions: `1`
- Example usage: `y`

`In [2]:`
```python
vector = torch.tensor([6, 9, 4, 2, 0])
vector, vector.ndim, vector.shape
```

`Out[2]:`
```python
(tensor([6, 9, 4, 2, 0]),
 1,
 torch.Size([5]))
```

> **Counting Dimensions**: Count the open square brackets at the beginning of a tensor.

<br />

**Matrix**: Has two dimensions (can contain "sub-list," in the concept of Python).

`In [3]:`
```python
MATRIX = torch.tensor([
  [6, 9, 4],
  [2, 0, 6]
])
MATRIX.shape
```

`Out[3]:`
```python
torch.Size([2, 3])
```

> This implices that the first dimension has two items (sub-lists), and the second dimension has three elements (numbers).

<br />

**Tensor**: Has three dimensions.

`In [4]:`
```python
TENSOR = torch.tensor([
  [
    [1, 9, 8, 9],
    [0, 6, 0, 4]
  ]
])
TENSOR.shape
```

`Out[4]:`
```python
torch.Size([1, 2, 4])
```

> This implies: for the first dimension, there is only one item; for the second dimension, there are two items; for the third dimension, there are four numbers.
